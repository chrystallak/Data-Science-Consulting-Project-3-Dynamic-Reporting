# Data-Science-Consulting-Project-3-Dynamic-Reporting
Uses R code and R shiny to create a dynamic dashboard for the client

Project 3 Instructions

A large telecommunications company conducts a marketing survey to better understand the perceptions about their products and the competition. Our consulting team has worked with the company to identify a variety of questions to answer. This client would also benefit from building a dynamic reporting engine that can be run as a shiny application in R.

In addition to building these tools, our team would also like you to identify opportunities for the client to make use of the information you’re working with in novel ways.

This project is divided into 4 parts:

Part 1: Summarizing the data.
Part 2: Answering specific questions about the respondents and their perceptions of the industry’s products.
Part 3: Building a dynamic reporting engine to explore many facets of the survey’s information.
Part 4: Identifying opportunities.
